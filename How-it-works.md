# LED Candles - How it works

## 1. Design
The Intel logo in this project is 3D printed for real candle like structure.


## 2. Sensor
Mic sensor is used to imitate lighting off the candles by blowing air on it.


## 3. Circuit
The circuitry for blowing off the candles is attached with Intel Genuino 101 board - which connects the LEDs and sensor.


## 4. Development
The vibrations generated inside the mic sensor by blowing air produces a numerical value - which will be captured to imitate this action. Few lines of code pushed to Intel Genuino 101 controls the LEDs, when the value from the sensor exceeds a threshold value.

## 5. Working Demo
